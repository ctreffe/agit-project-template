# Task Handoff

- Status: ready for authorized follow-up commit
- Outcome: Project initialization now replaces inherited template maintenance
  entries in `CHANGELOG.md` and `TASK_HANDOFF.md` with project-owned state, and
  ordinary commit preparation reinduces exact direct prefixes and meaningful
  bodies.
- Decisions: Preserve source-template lineage in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. Perform
  the history reset only after successful setup and never rewrite an existing
  active derived project through initialization cleanup.
- Changed files: commit, creation and initialization skills; `REPOSITORY.md`;
  `PROJECT_SETUP.md`; changelog; and this handoff.
- Checks: The targeted production skill validator and `git diff --check` pass.
  At commit preparation the complete Family gate must pass once after this
  final handoff update.
- Preserved unrelated state: The amended predecessor commit retains its
  original tree. Existing derived projects were not inspected or changed, and
  push remains unauthorized.
- Open points: Observe future initialized projects for clean project-owned
  history and retain the later retrospective-transfer behavioral follow-up.
- Next step: Create and verify the separately authorized follow-up commit after
  the Family gate; do not push.
