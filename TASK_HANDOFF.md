# Task Handoff

- Status: completed and validated
- Outcome: The resident router now interrupts recurring tool or environment
  failures for durable authorized diagnosis and verified recovery.
- Decisions: Retry once only when plausibly transient; otherwise pause, diagnose,
  fix within existing authority, verify and resume. TVDR-0024 owns the family
  decision.
- Changed files: `AGENTS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` and `TASK_HANDOFF.md`.
- Checks: Router rule and 2006-byte budget pass; `git diff --check` and the
  complete Templateverse suite pass.
- Preserved unrelated state: Generic project, material, access and Git controls
  remain unchanged. Staging, history and remotes are unchanged; commit and push
  remain unauthorized.
- Open points: None for this rollout.
- Next step: Await repository-specific explicit ordinary-commit authorization.
