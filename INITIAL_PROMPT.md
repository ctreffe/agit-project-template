# Initial Project Prompt

Use this prompt as the first instruction to the AI assistant after creating a new project repository from the AGIT Project Template.

The purpose is to make the first session reproducible: the assistant should
read the repository, understand all template rules, ask for the required
maintainer-owned information, initialize the project files and prepare the first
project-specific setup state without taking Git history actions unless the
instruction for the specific action contains a recognized control word.

# Prompt

```text
We are starting a new AGIT project from the AGIT Project Template.

Please first read the repository fully enough to understand its structure,
collaboration model, Codex policy, setup guide, documentation standards,
repository standards, project context template, decision-record guidance,
working folders, current placeholders and initialization rules.

Pay special attention to:

- README.md
- PROJECT_SETUP.md
- DOCUMENTATION.md
- REPOSITORY.md
- PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
- DECISIONS.md
- ChatGPT.md
- CODEX.md
- PHILOSOPHY.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- VERSION

Then initialize this repository as a concrete project.

Follow PROJECT_SETUP.md. Ask me for all maintainer-owned information that is
required before project work should begin, including the problem space,
operating context, desired end state, intended users, maintainers or audience,
boundaries, non-goals, first roadmap milestones, validation or review
expectations, repository metadata, working-folder needs, source-sensitivity constraints, reviewed-derivative needs, decision-record needs
and any project-specific collaboration constraints.

Before reading raw private, unpublished, confidential, licensed or personal source materials, first inventory them at the metadata level and ask whether they may be inspected directly or should be represented by reviewed or anonymized derivatives.

Do not invent the project intent, roadmap, decision model, validation status or
repository direction. You may ask clarifying questions, point out gaps and give
feedback on structure, consistency, scope and feasibility, but I remain in
control of project direction and durable decisions.

After I provide the required information, update the project-specific files:

- README.md
- README.de.md, if kept
- PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- VERSION, if appropriate
- DECISIONS.md, if the project keeps generic PDR guidance
- working-folder README files, if their role changes
- any project-specific documentation created during setup

Preserve the collaboration model in ChatGPT.md and the local Codex policy in
CODEX.md unless I ask to change them.

Retain the initialization artifacts under their original names as provenance:

- PROJECT_SETUP.md
- INITIAL_PROMPT.md

In PROJECT_CONTEXT.md, record initialization status and date, the source
template version and commit, the latest template harmonization baseline and any
intentional template deviations. Treat DOCUMENTATION.md and REPOSITORY.md as
ongoing project rules that must be adapted and maintained. Remove an
initialization artifact only if I make a deliberate exception and the reason is
documented.

Do not stage, commit, tag, push, pull, merge, reset, rebase, switch branches or
otherwise modify Git history unless I instruct you to perform that specific Git
action and use a recognized control word: `explicit` or `explicitly` in
English, or the German word family `explizit`.

When the setup state is ready, provide:

- a concise change summary
- checks performed
- known limitations or open questions
- a suggested commit summary
- a suggested commit description
- a concise numbered list of decisions or next steps I should take, including
  any GitHub Desktop actions
```
