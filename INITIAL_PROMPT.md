# Initial Project Prompt

Use this prompt as the first instruction to the AI assistant after creating a new project repository from the AGIT Project Template.

For normal initialization, the maintainer only needs to give the prompt below to the assistant. The assistant applies `AGENTS.md`—automatically loaded where supported—reads and applies `PROJECT_SETUP.md` and the other setup files, presents every required maintainer decision and performs the repository updates; the maintainer does not execute those files separately.

The purpose is to make the first session reproducible: the assistant should
read the repository, understand all template rules, ask for the required
maintainer-owned information, initialize the project files and prepare the first
project-specific setup state without taking protected Git actions unless the
instruction for the specific action contains a recognized control word.

# Prompt

```text
We are starting a new AGIT project from the AGIT Project Template.

Apply AGENTS.md as the durable repository operating baseline. If it was not
loaded automatically, read it first. This prompt defines the one-time
initialization workflow; do not treat AGENTS.md alone as an instruction to
initialize or modify the template.

Please first read the repository fully enough to understand its structure,
collaboration model, Codex policy, setup guide, documentation standards,
repository standards, project context template, decision-record guidance,
working folders, current placeholders and initialization rules.

Pay special attention to:

- README.md
- PROJECT_SETUP.md
- DOCUMENTATION.md
- REPOSITORY.md
- PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
- DECISIONS.md
- ChatGPT.md
- CODEX.md
- PHILOSOPHY.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- VERSION

Then initialize this repository as a concrete project.

Follow PROJECT_SETUP.md. Ask me for all maintainer-owned information that is
required before project work should begin, including the problem space,
operating context, desired end state, intended users, maintainers or audience,
boundaries, non-goals, first roadmap milestones, validation or review
expectations, repository metadata, working-folder needs, source-sensitivity constraints, reviewed-derivative needs, decision-record needs
and any project-specific collaboration constraints.

Before reading raw private, unpublished, confidential, licensed or personal source materials, first inventory them at the metadata level and ask whether they may be inspected directly or should be represented by reviewed or anonymized derivatives.

Do not invent the project intent, roadmap, decision model, validation status or
repository direction. You may ask clarifying questions, point out gaps and give
feedback on structure, consistency, scope and feasibility, but I remain in
control of project direction and durable decisions.

After I provide the required information, update the project-specific files:

- README.md
- README.de.md, if kept
- PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- VERSION, if appropriate
- DECISIONS.md, if the project keeps generic PDR guidance
- working-folder README files, if their role changes
- any project-specific documentation created during setup

Preserve the collaboration model in ChatGPT.md and the local Codex policy in
CODEX.md unless I ask to change them.

Adapt AGENTS.md only where the concrete project's commands, directory layout or
validation procedures differ from the template. Preserve its role as a concise
router to authoritative guidance, including its safety and project boundaries.

Establish the repository's external-file workflow during initialization. Use
`input/intake/` for unclassified arrivals, classify them into
`input/restricted/`, `input/local/` or `input/versioned/`, and maintain safe
metadata in `input/INVENTORY.md`. Treat assistant access, Git versioning and
external sharing as separate decisions. Do not inspect or move a file merely
because it is present; ask for any missing authorization or classification.

Retain the initialization files under their original names as provenance:

- PROJECT_SETUP.md
- INITIAL_PROMPT.md

In PROJECT_CONTEXT.md, record initialization status and date, the source
template version and commit, the latest template harmonization baseline and any
intentional template deviations. Treat DOCUMENTATION.md and REPOSITORY.md as
ongoing project rules that must be adapted and maintained. Remove an
initialization file only if I make a deliberate exception and the reason is
documented.

Staging and unstaging do not require a control word, but perform them only when
I specifically request the index action or authorize the corresponding commit.
Preserve existing staged selections and unrelated changes.

Do not commit, amend, tag, push, pull, merge, reset, rebase, switch branches,
manipulate stashes or perform another protected Git action unless I instruct
you to perform that specific Git
action and use a recognized control word: `explicit` or `explicitly` in
English, or the German word family `explizit`.

When the setup state is ready, provide:

- a concise change summary
- checks performed
- known limitations or open questions
- a suggested commit summary
- a suggested commit description
- a concise numbered list of decisions or next steps I should take, including
  any GitHub Desktop actions
```
